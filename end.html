  <h1>Disc Golf is a social activity!</h1>
  <p>Disc Golf is a very fun and welcoming community, especially in Maine. As a matter of fact,
  <a href="https://infinitediscs.com/blog/state-of-disc-golf-2015-popularity-around-the-world/">according to this survey</a> the state of Maine<br>
  has the highest disc golfers per capita of anywhere in the world!
  <br><br>
  In order to show this, below is a video taken 2 years ago at a tournament I played at called "The McBeast Challenge", which is basically a couple of<br> professional players
  that tour around the country and hold these challenges.
  <br><br>
  This particular one, which was held at Pleasant Hill DGC in Scarborough Maine, was (and still is) the largest tournament of this type ever, with over 200 players!</p><br><br>
