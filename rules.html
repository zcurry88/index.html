  <h1>What are the rules?</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Disc Golf is a game played according to mostly the same rules as traditional golf.<br>
          The main difference, of course, is instead of hitting a ball into a hole with a club, you throw frisbees at a basket!<br>
      The object of the game is to get your disc into the basket in as few throws as possible.</p>
